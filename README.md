# DL2
Second assignment Deep learning course at IISc Bangalore.

The assignment deals with image classification problem (FashionMNIST dataset) using:
1. Multi-layer perceptron architecture
2. Custom Convolutional Neural Network

The results are saved in two text files - multi-layer-net.txt and convolutional-neural-networks.txt
The results are as expected: The CNN model performs better than the MLP model.
